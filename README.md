Hi There! This is a simple employee assigning related app that I made using React JS, CSS3. I have fetched data through own made JSON server. Here are the functionality given below.

# About App
## 1. Can assign new employee by monitoring their information and biodata.
## 2. Expected salary will be added immediately after adding a candidate.
## 3. Added candidate count will also be counted as well except already selected candidates.
## 4. After assigning candidate their name with image will be updated to side bar.
## 5. This is a useful app for the beginners who want to start journey with React, so don't be shy, don't be worried, let's get started with React JS ;):D
